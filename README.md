Questions to answer:
1. Move the clusters around and change their sizes to make it easier or
harder for the classifier to find a decent boundary. Pay attention
to when the optimizer (minimize function) is not able to find a
solution at all.
2. Implement the two non-linear kernels. You should be able to clas-
sify very hard data sets with these.
3. The non-linear kernels have parameters; explore how they influence
the decision boundary. Reason about this in terms of the bias-
variance trade-off.
4. Explore the role of the slack parameter C. What happens for very
large/small values?
5. Imagine that you are given data that is not easily separable. When
should you opt for more slack rather than going for a more complex
model (kernel) and vice versa?
